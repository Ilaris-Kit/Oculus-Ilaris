# Oculus Ilaris

*Oculus Ilaris* is a project aiming at providing an Ilaris game master or even players with additional utility during game sessions. 

It is written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and should thus run on various devices. It requires an active internet connection in order to import JQuery and pull the current rules database from the Sephrasto project. 

Characters can be imported if given in the XML format produced by Sephrasto.

All user data is stored in the HTML5 localStorage.
